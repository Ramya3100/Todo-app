# To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do app built using HTML and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, view them in a list, and delete tasks when they're done.

## Features
- Add a new task.
- Display tasks in a list.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Case-insensitive task validation to avoid duplicates.

## View the Project

## Installation
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
2. Enter a task in the input field.
3. Click the "Add task" button to add the task to the list.
4. To delete a task, click the "delete" button next to the task.

## Files
- `index.html`: The HTML structure for the To-Do app.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for adding, displaying, and deleting tasks.

## How it Works
1. The user can input a task and click the "Add task" button to add it to the list.
2. The app checks if the task is empty or already exists in the list. If valid, the task is added.
3. Each task has a "delete" button. When clicked, the task is removed from the list.
